#### Assignment 2 for COSC1295 [Semester 1, 2018]

## Main Menu Scene
When running the application, the user is greeted with the following Main Menu:

The first thing I plan on doing is to amend `Connection` so that the collection of connections will be an instance variable of `Driver` (similar to `members`).  This will be tricky and will require amending much of the code.  These amendments will be committed to this repository as they progress.

Also, the `mainMenu` method in `Driver` will be amended to reflect the requirements of Assignment 2.  Some of the functionality that I included in my Assignment 1 is surplus to what is required in Assignment 2 but will be included if time permits.
