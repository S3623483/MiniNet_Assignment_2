### Display Profile
If the user clicks on the **Display A Profile** button, they are taken to the following screen:

The list includes __**all**__ current members of MiniNet. The user must select (click on) the `userID` of the member whose profile they wish to view and click the **Select** button. Please note that the first item in the member listing is automatically selected which avoids any non-selection errors being thrown. Once the **Select** button has been pressed, the *Profile Viewer* opens in a separate window and looks like the following:

The user must click the **Close** button in the *Profile Viewer* before they can re-commence using the main GUI.

### Add A Connection

### Query Connection

### Exit
The GUI closes and the terminates when the **Exit** button is clicked.
